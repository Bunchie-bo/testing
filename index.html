      <p>Created a GitHub page for the SMA tools, this will inclue a map maker with a NPC creator where you can set dialogue etc. the general tile placement and tile picker will be the first thing to get done before I move on to anything else.</p>

      <h2>Doom Clone</h2>
      <h5>Side Project, 7/2/23 4:09 PM</h5>
      <p>Started a side project to play around with 3D, and learn some things that I wont get to mess around with on SMA, also a good way to take a break, and do something else with out getting burned out, but also still practice game dev. I hope to release a few small fully indie games soon in the hopes to compleate a game jam. A doom clone seemed to be a fun way to get started, I used pictures of my airsoft gun for the pistol, it looks alright for a start. Thinking about adding a shot gun too, but ill need to make the actual shooting machanic fist since its just an antimation ATM.</p>
